# Average Salary for Data Science Jobs

This is a ETL pipeline that will gather data from a jobs list [CSV dataset](https://gitlab.com/zourethe/avg-salary-for-data-science-jobs/-/blob/main/env/src/dataset/jobs_list.csv) with their respective salaries and functions, and make a MySQL database with the average salary of each type of job. The dataset was made by [Hummaam Qaasim](https://www.kaggle.com/hummaamqaasim) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hummaamqaasim/jobs-in-data?resource=download).
